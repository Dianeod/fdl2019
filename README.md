## Introduction
In the associated notebook, we examineed how machine learning methods can be used to predict flood susceptibility in an area. The notebook focuses on the problems of predicting the flood susceptibility of an area and predicting the time taken for a river to reach its peak height after a rainfall event. Kdb+ was used to manage the time-series data, while Random Forest and XGBoost models were deployed via embedPy and the ML-Toolkit.

A more in depth discussion of the project can be found on ....

## Requirements

- embedPy

The python packages required to allow successful exectution of all functions within the machine learning toolkit can be installed via:

pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or via conda:
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
